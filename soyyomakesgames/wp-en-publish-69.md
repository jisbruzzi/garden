The Awesome Aranhaman in wich you have to advance by the level swinging. It's a lot like other games "ala spiderman" that are on the web, just that with this one, althought playing with the mouse you play with Z and X. One button to roll, the other one to launch the web and both at the same time to impulse yourself

<p style="text-align:left;">I made it for the "music interpretation contest" at Gamejolt, that hasn't yet ended...
The music was made by ema sempai ( ema_demian(arroba)hotmail.com ), and althought it doesn't fit perfectly with the graphics it isn't bad at all.</p>
