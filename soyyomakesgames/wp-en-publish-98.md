<p>Well, it`s been a long time I don`t post anything... But it didn`t happen much in the last months of my virtual life, mostly because I`ve been really busy in my new school, wich is much harder than the one I used to go. And, in my efforts of keeping the same grades, I have had to spend much less time in front of the computer, making games.<br>
   But summer time is coming to an end, and I used the time I had to learn new things...<br>
   First of all, I finished this C book and made some complicated program with it. And I`m really proud of what I got ^_^ . Then, I started reading Java. I ate the book in a week (miracles happen in summer), and made a tetris with the bare graphics basics the book teached me. Now, I readed half of an Action Script 3 book. The reason why I didn`t eat it like the java one is that it`s poorly written. But AS3 is almost the same as java, so I I`m learning more than the book teachs.</p>
<p>I`ve also gained 15 Kg of weight, wich I plan to lose in 2012. Be ready for some kind of gamification experiment.</p>
<p>And my second goal for 2012 is to make one cent with a flash game. For this, I`ll have to make some really good game so that some portal accepts it. I`m really whilling to see if I can get some money (no matter how much) from game making.</p>
<p>And about new games...<br>
2011 has been my most productive year so far, with The Return to Cucken finished and some interesting game prototypes in my computer. If I make any GM game in 2012, I know it will have some quality, 1 or 2 may get finished before July, but I`ll try to focus more in flash and maybe make something interesting with java, so that I gain some experience, but overall I`ll focus on AS3.</p>
<p>PS: cutting-down and releasing The Theory of The Everything is another possibility.<br>
