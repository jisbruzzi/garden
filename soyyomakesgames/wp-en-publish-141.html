  <p><span style="color:#999999;">Foreword: I'm still struggling to understand Pony's capabilities and everything below may be just wrong. Also, this article does not replace <a href="http://tutorial.ponylang.org">the tutorial</a>.</span></p>
<p>For a course on programming languages, we have decided to learn the Pony language. Learning Pony has been something really pleasant and easy until I came across capabilities. Looking for an easy and simple way to understand them, I found this. I call this &quot;The deny properties matrix from hell&quot;. Not because it's evil, but because I find it really hard to learn from that diagram and also because it's evil.</p>
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_160&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;989&quot;]<img class=" size-full wp-image-160 aligncenter" src="https://soyyomakesgames.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/matrix-from-hell.png" alt="matrix-from-hell" width="989" height="738" /> Evil. <a href="http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~scd/Pony-WG2.16.pdf">Source  </a>[/caption]</p>
<p>Ok, so I know this denying capabilities stuff is very formally correct, but it's too hard to understand. So I re-wrote it thinking about what you <em>allow</em> instead of what you <em>deny</em>, and everything started to make sense. Of course, you can scroll down and see it right now but the idea of this article is to -sort of- deduce it so you can see how obvious and logical everything is.</p>
<h1>About iso and the point of all this</h1>
Two threads can't just share data: writes can happen simultaneously with reads and things get corrupted pretty easily. For two threads to share data, you either:
<ul>
	<li>Only allow both threads to read</li>
	<li>You allow full access to shared data in turns: only Thread A or Thread B can write and read from at a time.</li>
</ul>
Which means: you either share immutable data or <strong>pass</strong> mutable data. Traditionally, passing data is done with locks and mutexes. In pony, this is done with <strong>iso</strong>.
<p>The whole point of pony is that actors send and receive messages, but the content of those messages <strong>must</strong> be either:</p>
<ul>
	<li>opaque: something you can't read nor write to, only identify it. (tag)</li>
	<li>immutable. (val)</li>
	<li>mutable but isolated: If you send the thing you can't <strong>EVER</strong> read from or write to it again. (iso)</li>
</ul>
What's cool about this is that you don't need to copy stuff when you send messages. In other languages, to send data to another thread you either:
<p>a)copy everything you are passing in the message to be sure that the other thread doesn't touch your data.</p>
<p>b)put some locks here and there</p>
<p>In pony, that need vanishes because of reference capabilities.</p>
<p>So <strong>you can share mutable data with iso without copying it and with no mutexes</strong>. That's the point of all this.</p>
<h1>The security scale</h1>
This is sort of obvious, but let's say it:
<p>[caption id=&quot;attachment_243&quot; align=&quot;aligncenter&quot; width=&quot;640&quot;]<img class=" size-full wp-image-243 aligncenter" src="https://soyyomakesgames.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/security-scale.png" alt="security-scale" width="640" height="300" /> The colours[/caption]</p>
<p>We're going to talk about reference capabilities, so just forget about the &quot;No access&quot; part.</p>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-254" src="https://soyyomakesgames.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/security-scale1.png" alt="security-scale" width="640" height="300" />
<h1>Here comes the matrix</h1>
In most papers and talks about Pony, "local" means <em>this thread/actor</em> and "global" means <em>other thread/actor</em>. This is the same matrix as before, just in terms of what you are allowed to do through the reference instead of what you can't do.
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-271" src="https://soyyomakesgames.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/capabilities-matrix.png" alt="capabilities-matrix" width="900" height="600" />
<p>Iso and trn are problematic, because as said before it's unsafe for two threads to write to the same data, and for a thread to read data which can be written to by other thread (you can get a data structure that is half-updated!). So iso and trn only make sense if they are <em>unique references</em>. This means that only one actor has access and data never gets corrupted.</p>
<h1>Sendables</h1>
iso, val and tag are the only sendable reference types because what <em>this actor</em> can do to the references is the same as what <em>the other actor</em> can.
<h1>Here comes the Hasse diagram</h1>
<a href="https://tutorial.ponylang.org/capabilities/capability-subtyping.html">Capability subtyping</a>, from the tutorial, establishes which reference types can be assigned to which. You should read that. Here is the Hasse diagram:
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-308" src="https://soyyomakesgames.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/hasse.png" alt="hasse" width="640" height="480" />
<p>Note that the Hasse diagram also shows transitivity: box is safer than val and tag is safer that box so tag is safer than val. This means you can:</p>
<p>var number_val:U32 val = 5</p>
<p>var number_tag:U32 tag = number_val</p>
<p>However, you can't just:</p>
<p>var iso_thing:Thing iso = ....</p>
<p>var ref_thing:Thing ref = iso_thing</p>
<p>because of the uniqueness of iso.</p>
<h1>See how it makes sense</h1>
<img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-337" src="https://soyyomakesgames.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/capabilities-matrix-con-hasse.png" alt="capabilities-matrix-con-hasse" width="900" height="600" />
<p>Here I tried to put the hasse diagram on top of the matrix. See how you deny one thing at a time?</p>
<h1>iso only makes sense thanks to consume</h1>
I mentioned how you can't
<p>var ref_thing:Thing ref = iso_thing</p>
<p>this is because of the uniqueness of iso: by performing that assignment, you create a new reference to iso_thing so it's not isolated anymore. Instead, what you must do is:</p>
<p>var ref_thing:Thing ref = consume iso_thing</p>
<p>Consuming iso_thing sort of destroys the reference: you can't use it anymore, it's a compile-time error!</p>
<h1>recover lets you change the reference type (in the other direction)</h1>
With assignments and consume you can only go downwards (I mean down the matrix: from iso to ref, from val to box and such). However, recover blocks let you go upwards (e.g. from ref to iso).
<p>In fact, you can also go downwards and right (just like with assignments)(Thing.create() returns a ref)</p>
<p>var iso_thing:Thing iso = recover Thing.create() end</p>
<p>var val_thing:Thing val = recover Thing.create() end</p>
<p>recover will by default return the topmost reference type (iso, val, tag), which is all you need anyways. You can also specify a target reference type, for example:</p>
<p>var trn_thing:Thing trn = recover <strong>trn</strong> Thing.create() end</p>
<h1>recover isn't cheating</h1>
Inside the recover block you can only access iso, val and tag references from the scope, which ensures thread-safety, as discussed in "about iso and the point of all this".
<p>So no, it's not cheating.</p>
<h1>Final words</h1>
I hope this was useful. Please point out any mistakes in the comments or e-mail me.
