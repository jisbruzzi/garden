<strong><a title="linky!" href="http://gamejolt.com/freeware/games/arcade/dancing-dancing-dancing-dancing-dancing/6781/" target="_blank">Download the game from gamejolt here!</a></strong>

This game was made for this months EGP. Althought it's supposed to be played with pads, you can play it with the 1-2-3-4-5 buttons.

When I first read this moth's theme, I really loved the idea of people jumping on their pads like they were dancing/jumping at a club. Also, I thught that the people jumping on their pads harmonically could be fun to watch, as they are coordinated. This game would obligate them to coordinate those jumps.

The team that hits more notes makes more points.

Also, this game can be played by a minimum of three people, because you could have two of them "dancing" over two pads.

Yes, it's written in german. Dont worry, I don't understand it neiter. Simply press F1 and voil√°, texts translate to english.

Press escape to quit.

"RegistroCancion1.txt" must be in the same folder as the .exe for the game to run without errors.

Game's music was made by Covox and is named "Jet alone" License here: http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/

Have fun!
