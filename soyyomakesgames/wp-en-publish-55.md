Its a hardcore platformer game, based on the idea of <em>permadeath. </em>The levels are short to bring a sensation of continuous challenge and I tried to add as much variety as I could.

Retro styled and with the excellent music of Mariano Frumento, has 17 levels. Its pretty short, but I tried to make it pretty funny.

I tried to innovate on the mechanics: there are three types of enemies, and each one of them gives you a power:

Then, the astronaut lets you do walljumping, the crocodile gives you the power of walljumping and the assasain lets you reverse the gravity- its great for long jumps ala VVVVV
