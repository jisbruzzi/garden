This is my second game for this month's Experimental Gameplay Project. It was made in 6 hours O_O

You use 1-2-3-4-5 as the pads that should be in the instalation where the game is supposed to be played.

You move the bar that's below in the screen with 1-2-3-4-5 to grab as much snow as possible before time finishes. It'd be cool to have the player running around to press the pads. He/she could even get tired of running while playing.

I used some code of my first entry, wich I started threed days ago and finished yesterday.Â Yeah, I'm in the creative rush.

Game's music was made by Covox and is named "Jet alone" . License here:<a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/">http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/</a>
