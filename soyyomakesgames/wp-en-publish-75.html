<p>This game was made for this months EGP. Althought it's supposed to be played with pads, you can play it with the 1-2-3-4-5 buttons.</p>
<p>When I first read this moth's theme, I really loved the idea of people jumping on their pads like they were dancing/jumping at a club. Also, I thught that the people jumping on their pads harmonically could be fun to watch, as they are coordinated. This game would obligate them to coordinate those jumps.</p>
<p>The team that hits more notes makes more points.</p>
<p>Also, this game can be played by a minimum of three people, because you could have two of them &quot;dancing&quot; over two pads.</p>
<p>Yes, it's written in german. Dont worry, I don't understand it neiter. Simply press F1 and voilá, texts translate to english.</p>
<p>Press escape to quit.</p>
<p>&quot;RegistroCancion1.txt&quot; must be in the same folder as the .exe for the game to run without errors.</p>
