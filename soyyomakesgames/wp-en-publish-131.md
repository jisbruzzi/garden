<a title="Jugar!" href="http://gamejolt.com/games/platformer/missile-walker/11236/" target="_blank">Play it now!</a>

Missile Walker is a game I made for CODEAR:Hardcore. It's a frenetic platformer game where the player must avoid and mount missiles shot at her to win the game. You also have the ability to stop time, wich lets you do very precise movements.

The graphics are minimalist, but the many effects I apply makes the player enjoy them.

Two friends of mine made the music. Check out <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ae2oficial" target="_blank">their facebook page</a>!

The images you can see below are from an older version of the game, but the graphics didn't change much since then.
